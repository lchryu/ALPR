feat: improve OCR pipeline with multi-pass processing and deskew

- Add multi-pass OCR with 7+ preprocessing variants for better accuracy
- Implement deskew/rotation correction with angle threshold (2.0°)
- Add support for two-line motorcycle plate detection and splitting
- Improve preprocessing pipeline with adaptive scaling, CLAHE, and sharpening
- Add Vietnamese plate pattern validation and post-processing
- Enhance character detection with border contour removal
- Optimize OCR parameters for better thin character detection (e.g., '1')
- Add comprehensive visualization with preprocessing steps in detect_single.py
- Update utils.py with improved preprocessing and OCR functions
- Add FastAPI demo endpoint for ALPR service
- Update README.md with pipeline information
